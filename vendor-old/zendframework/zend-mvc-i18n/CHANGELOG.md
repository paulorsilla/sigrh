## 0.1.0 - 2016-03-30

First (stable) release.

This component replaces the various i18n utilities in zend-mvc and zend-router,
and provides integration between each of those components and zend-i18n.

While this is a stable release, please wait to use it until a v3 release of
zend-mvc, which will remove those features, to ensure everything works together
as expected.
