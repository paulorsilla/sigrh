            If not, you will need to add the component as a module to your
            application. Add the entry <code>'Zend\Mvc\Plugin\FilePrg'</code> to
            your list of modules in your application configuration (typically
            one of <code>config/application.config.php</code> or
            <code>config/modules.config.php</code>).

      <h2>Usage</h2>

      <p>
        While similar to the <a
          href="https://zendframework.github.io/zend-mvc-plugin-prg">Post/Redirect/Get
          Plugin</a>, the File PRG Plugin will work for forms with file inputs.
        The difference is in the behavior: The File PRG Plugin will interact
        directly with your form instance and the file inputs, rather than
        <em>only</em> returning the POST params from the previous request.
      </p>

      <p>
        By interacting directly with the form, the File PRG Plugin will turn off any
        file inputs <code>required</code> flags for already uploaded files (for a partially valid
        form state), as well as run the file input filters to move the uploaded files
        into a new location (configured by the user).
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <h3>Files must be relocated on upload</h3>
        
        <p>
          You <strong>must</strong> attach a filter for moving the uploaded files to a new location, such as the
          <a href="https://zendframework.github.io/zend-filter/file/#renameupload">RenameUpload Filter</a>,
          or else your files will be removed upon the redirect.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This plugin is invoked with three arguments:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>$form</code>: the <code>Zend\Form\Form</code> instance.</li>
        <li><code>$redirect</code>: (Optional) a string containing the redirect
          location, which can either be a named route or a URL, based on the
          contents of the third parameter. If this argument is not provided, it
          will default to the current matched route.</li>
        <li><code>$redirectToUrl</code>: (Optional) a boolean that when set to
          <code>TRUE</code>, causes the second parameter to be treated as a URL
          instead of a route name (this is required when redirecting to a URL
          instead of a route). This argument defaults to
          <code>FALSE</code>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Example Usage</h3>

      <pre><code class="lang-php" data-trim>
$myForm = new Zend\Form\Form('my-form');
$myForm->add([
    'type' => 'Zend\Form\Element\File',
    'name' => 'file',
]);

// NOTE: Without a filter to move the file,
//       our files will disappear between the requests
$myForm->getInputFilter()->getFilterChain()->attach(
    new Zend\Filter\File\RenameUpload([
        'target'    => './data/tmpuploads/file',
        'randomize' => true,
    ])
);

// Pass in the form and optional the route/url you want to redirect to after the POST
$prg = $this->fileprg($myForm, '/user/profile-pic', true);

if ($prg instanceof \Zend\Http\PhpEnvironment\Response) {
    // Returned a response to redirect us.
    return $prg;
}

if ($prg === false) {
    // First time the form was loaded.
    return array('form' => $myForm);
}

// Form was submitted.
// $prg is now an array containing the POST params from the previous request,
// but we don't have to apply it to the form since that has already been done.

// Process the form
if ($form->isValid()) {
    // ...Save the form...
    return $this->redirect()->toRoute('/user/profile-pic/success');
}

// Form not valid, but file uploads might be valid and uploaded
$fileErrors = $form->get('file')->getMessages();
if (empty($fileErrors)) {
    $tempFile = $form->get('file')->getValue();
}
