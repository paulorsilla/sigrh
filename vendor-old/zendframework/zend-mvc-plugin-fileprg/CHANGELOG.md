- [#2](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc-plugin-fileprg/pull/2) pins the

  v2 versions.

## 0.1.0 - 2016-03-29

First (stable) release.

This component replaces the `FilePostRedirectGet` (aka `fileprg()`) plugin from
zend-mvc, for use with upcoming v3 of that component. Once that stable release
is made, we will issue a 1.0.0 release removing the `dev-develop as 3.0.0`
zend-mvc constraint.
