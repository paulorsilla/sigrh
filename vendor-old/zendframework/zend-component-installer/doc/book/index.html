      <h2>Installable Packages</h2>

      <p>
        How do you define a package for which zend-component-installer will
        install configuration?
      </p>

      <h3>Components</h3>

      <p>
        Components are Zend Framework modules that deliver low-level
        functionality; examples include the various Zend Framework components
        themselves. These require the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A <code>Module</code> class in the package namespace.</li>
        <li>An <code>extra.zf.component</code> entry listing the package
          namespace in your <code>composer.json</code>.</li>
      </ul>

      <pre><code class="lang-json" data-trim>
"extra": {
  "zf": {
    "component": "Some\\Component"
  }
}
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        You may also specify multiple components as an array:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="lang-json" data-trim>
"extra": {
  "zf": {
    "component": [
      "Some\\Component",
      "Other\\Component"
    ]
  }
}
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Your application will need to have one or more of the following
        configuration files, from which you will be prompted to choose which one
        in which to inject the component:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>config/application.config.php</code> (vanilla ZF2 application)</li>
        <li><code>config/modules.config.php</code> (<a href="https://apigility.org">Apigility</a>
          application)</li>
        <li><code>config/development.config.php.dist</code> and
          <code>config/development.config.php</code> (applications using
          <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zend-development-mode">zend-development-mode</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Components are added at the <strong>top</strong> of the application's
        list of modules.
      </p>

      <h3>Modules</h3>

      <p>
        Zend Framework modules typically deliver functionality around the
        <a href="https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-mvc/">zend-mvc</a>
        workflow, including MVC event listeners, controllers, etc.
        To enable the installer workflow, they require the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A <code>Module</code> class in the package namespace.</li>
        <li>An <code>extra.zf.module</code> entry listing the package
          namespace in your <code>composer.json</code>.</li>
      </ul>

      <pre><code class="lang-json" data-trim>
"extra": {
  "zf": {
    "module": "Some\\Component"
  }
}
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        You may also specify multiple modules as an array:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="lang-json" data-trim>
"extra": {
  "zf": {
    "module": [
      "Some\\Component",
      "Other\\Component"
    ]
  }
}
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Your application will need to have one or more of the following
        configuration files, from which you will be prompted to choose which one
        in which to inject the module:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>config/application.config.php</code> (vanilla ZF2 application)</li>
        <li><code>config/modules.config.php</code> (<a href="https://apigility.org">Apigility</a>
          application)</li>
        <li><code>config/development.config.php.dist</code> and
          <code>config/development.config.php</code> (applications using
          <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zend-development-mode">zend-development-mode</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Modules are added at the <strong>bottom</strong> of the application's
        list of modules.
      </p>

      <h3>Config Providers</h3>

      <p>
        Configuration providers work with
        <a href="https://github.com/mtymek/expressive-config-manager">expressive-config-manager</a>
        and <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zend-config-aggregator">zend-config-aggregator</a>,
        which provides generic functionality for aggregating and merging
        application configuration. Packages that provide configuration will
        provide an invokable class that returns configuration for the package.
        To enable the installer workflow, you will need:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A configuration provider class. This is a class with no constructor
          arguments defining an <code>__invoke()</code> method returning a
          configuration array.</li>
        <li>An <code>extra.zf.config-provider</code> entry listing the
          configuration provider class in your <code>composer.json</code>.</li>
      </ul>

      <pre><code class="lang-php" data-trim>
namespace Some\Component;

class ConfigProvider
{
    public function __invoke()
    {
        return [ /* ... */ ];
    }
}
      </code></pre>

      <pre><code class="lang-json" data-trim>
"extra": {
  "zf": {
    "config-provider": "Some\\Component\\ConfigProvider"
  }
}
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        You may also specify multiple configuration providers as an array:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="lang-json" data-trim>
"extra": {
  "zf": {
    "config-provider": [
      "Some\\Component\\ConfigProvider",
      "Some\\Component\\PluginConfigProvider",
    ]
  }
}
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Your application will need to define a <code>config/config.php</code>
        file, and that file will need to have a line that instantiates either a
        <code>Zend\Expressive\ConfigManager\ConfigManager</code> instance
        (deprecated) or <code>Zend\ConfigAggregator\ConfigAggregator</code>
        instance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Configuration providers are added at the <strong>top</strong> of the
        <code>ConfigManager</code>/<code>ConfigAggregator</code> provider array.
      </p>

            You can also install the plugin globally, in which case it will be

          </p>

          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ composer global require zendframework/zend-component-installer</code></pre>

        <div class="panel-heading">
          <h2 class="panel-title">Why?</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>
            When preparing zend-mvc's version 3 release, we wanted to reduce the
            number of components required by the package. To do so, we moved
            integration code, such as factories, plugin managers, and event
            listeners into the components they consumed. This had a side effect:
            the components were no longer wired automatically.
          </p>

          <p>
            To provide service and event wiring, we added <code>Module</code>
            classes (and configuration providers) to all Zend Framework components.
            This exposed a new problem, however: how could we ensure that those
            components are added to the application module list as you add them
            to your application?
          </p>

          <p>
            This package provides the answer to that problem. As soon as you add
            this package to your application, whenever you add a component or module
            that exposes itself as such, the plugin will prompt you, asking where
            you want to inject it.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="panel panel-info">
        <div class="panel-heading">
          <h2 class="panel-title">When are multiple items required?</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>
            As noted under each of the component, module, and config-provider
            sections, you can optionally specify an <em>array</em> of items. When
            would you do this?
          </p>

          <p>
            The primary reason is for <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#type">metapackages</a>.
            Composer does not trigger either <code>post-package-install</code>
            or <code>post-package-uninstall</code> events for packages defined
            as metapackage requirements. As such, you would define the metadata
            for such packages in the metapackage as well, to ensure that the
            component installer can update the configuration accordingly.
          </p>

          <p>
            The other use case is to allow specifying multiple configuration
            providers from the same package. As an example, you might define
            default configuration, plus configuration for plugins; specifying
            these as separate configuration providers allows the consumer to
            choose if they want both enabled in their application.
          </p>

            <div class="panel-heading">
              <h2 class="panel-title">Removing individual packages</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>
                When removing individual packages that were originally installed
                via a metapackage, <em>the component installer will not
                trigger</em>. As such, you will need to manually remove such
                packages from your configuration.
              </p>

              <p>
                Additionally, a later update may actually <em>re-install</em>
                the package, as it's a requirement of the metapackage. As such,
                it's typically safer to:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Remove the metapackage</li>
                <li>Individually install the packages from the metapackage that
                  you wish to keep.</li>
